ReadsMap program is implemented under python 2.7 version.
ReadsMap allows to map single end reads against reference sequence (RNAs) using TMAP aligner.

The version used for TMAP  is 3.0.1 
The version used for samtools is 0.1.19

Setting:
Parameters could be adjusted by modifying the configuration file MapReads.Config.


Input:
The program requires the Fastqfiles from the sequencer to add to "FastqFiles" folder and the reference sequences to put
in the "FastaFiles" folder. Examples of input files are provided. The input folders should be decompressed in 
the same directory as the program.

The command line to run ReadsMap program:
    python ReadsMap.py

Output:
The program first generates a global fasta file containing all the sequences.
Then, it performs a mapping via TMAP program,this results in generating mapped reads in SAM/BAM formats[SamFiles/ BamFiles].
In addition, the program generates the input reads format required to run SHAPEMapper program,namely:
RNA_of_reference, Read_starting_position, quality , Cigar_code, sequence, Phred-Q

ReadsMap advantages:
-Many fastqfiles could be treated simultaneously as well as many reference sequences
-Generates input for SHAPEMapper program for single end reads
-If the option ReadsAnalysis is set to True, a file 'ReadsAnalysis.txt' that contains details about the mapping statistics is generated.
